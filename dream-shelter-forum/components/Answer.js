          Hi, While there isn't a formal ranking for the MS in Data Sciences
          program - the following universities have great course content and
          recruiters. I am including a snapshot of these for your reference:
          Arizona State University: ASUâ€™s nine-month program focuses on using
          analytics in day-to-day business processes and managing it
          effectively. Required courses include data mining, applied regression
          models, analytical decision making tools and business analytics
          strategy. The curriculum also includes internship opportunities and a
          capstone practicum project with local Arizona companies such as
          American Express and Intel. 30 credit hours.
